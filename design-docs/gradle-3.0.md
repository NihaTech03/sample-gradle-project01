# Gradle 3.0

Gradle 3.0 is the next major Gradle release that offers the opportunity to make breaking changes to the public interface of Gradle. This document captures a laundry
list of ideas to consider before shipping Gradle 3.0.

Note: for the change listed below, the old behaviour or feature to be removed should be deprecated in a Gradle 2.x release. Similarly for changes to behaviour.

# Candidates for Gradle 3.0

The following stories are candidates to be included in a major release of Gradle. Currently, they are *not* scheduled to be included in Gradle 3.0.


## Test output directories

The current defaults for the outputs of tasks of type `Test` conflict with each other:

* Change the default result and report directory for the `Test` type to include the task's name, so that the default
  does not conflict with the default for any other `Test` task.
* Change the default TestNG output directory.

## Log changes

* Remove `--no-color` command-line option.
* Remove `LoggingConfiguration.colorOutput` property.
* Remove `LoggingManager.logLevel` property. Managing the log level should not be a concern of the build logic.
* Remove `Project.getLogging()` method. Would be replaced by the existing `logging` property on `Script` and `Task`.
* Move internal types `StandardOutputCapture`, `StandardOutputRedirector` and `LoggingManagerInternal` into an internal package.

## Archive tasks + base plugin

* Remove `org.gradle.api.tasks.bundling.Jar`, replaced by `org.gradle.jvm.tasks.Jar`.
* Move defaults for output directory and other attributes from the base plugin to an implicitly applied plugin, so that they are applied to all instances.
* Use `${task.name}.${task.extension}` as the default archive name, so that the default does not conflict with the default for any other archive task.

## Drop support for Gradle versions older than 1.0

* Cross version tests no longer test against anything earlier than 1.0
* Local artifact reuse no longer considers candidates from the artifact caches for Gradle versions earlier than 1.0
* Wrapper does not support downloading versions earlier than 1.0
* Remove old unused types that are baked into the bytecode of tasks compiled against older versions (eg `ConventionValue`). Fail with a reasonable
error message for these task types.

## Remove support for building against Java 5

Building against Java 5 requires that the compiler daemon and test execution infrastructure still support Java 5.

* Clean up `DefaultClassLoaderFactory`.
* Change `InetAddressFactory` so that it no longer uses reflection to inspect `NetworkInterface`.
* Replace usages of `guava-jdk5`.

## Remove Ant <depend> based incremental compilation backend

Now we have real incremental Java compilation, remove the `CompileOptions.useDepend` property and related options.

## Remove the Gradle Open API stubs

* Remove the remaining Open API interfaces and stubs.
* Remove the `openApi` project.

## Remove `group` and `status` from project

Alternatively, default the group to `null` and status to `integration`.

## Remove the Ant-task based Scala compiler

* Change the default for `useAnt` to `false` and deprecate the `useAnt` property.
* Do a better job of matching up the target jvm version with the scala compiler backend.

## Don't inject tools.jar into the system ClassLoader

Currently required for in-process Ant-based compilation on Java 5. Dropping support for one of (in-process, ant-based, java 5) would allow us to remove this.

## Decouple publishing DSL from Maven classes

* Change the old publishing DSL to use the Maven 3 classes instead of Maven 2 classes. This affects:
    * `MavenResolver.settings`
    * `MavenDeployer.repository` and `snapshotRepository`.
    * `MavenPom.dependencies`.
* Remove `MavenDeployer.addProtocolProviderJars()`.
* Change `PublishFilter` so that it accepts a `PublishArtifact` instead of an `Artifact`.

## Copy tasks

There are several inconsistencies and confusing behaviours in the copy tasks and copy spec:

* Change copy tasks so that they no longer implement `CopySpec`. Instead, they should have a `content` property which is a `CopySpec` that contains the main content.
  Leave behind some methods which operate on the file tree as a whole, eg `eachFile()`, `duplicatesStrategy`, `matching()`.
* Change the copy tasks so that `into` always refers to the root of the destination file tree, and that `destinationDir` (possibly with a better name) is instead used
  to specify the root of the destination file tree, for those tasks that produce a file tree on the file system.
* Change the `Jar` type so that there is a single `metaInf` copy spec which is a child of the main content, rather than creating a new copy spec each time `metainf`
  is referenced. Do the same for `War.webInf`.
* The `CopySpec.with()` method currently assumes that a root copy spec is supplied with all values specified, and no values are inherited by the attached copy spec.
  Instead, change `CopySpec.with()` so that values are inherited from the copy spec.
    * Change `CopySpec` so that property queries do not query the parent value, as a copy spec may have multiple parents. Or, alternatively, allow only root copy spec
      to be attached to another using `with()`.
* Change the default duplicatesStrategy to `fail` or perhaps `warn`.
* Change the `Ear` type so that the generated descriptor takes precedence over a descriptor in the main content, similar to the manifest for `Jar` and the
  web XML for `War`.

## Remove old dependency result graph

The old dependency result graph is expensive in terms of heap usage. We should remove it.

* Promote new dependency result graph to un-incubate it.
* Remove methods that use `ResolvedDependency` and `UnresolvedDependency`.
* Keep `ResolvedArtifact` and replace it later, as it is not terribly expensive to keep.

## Remove API methods that are added by the DSL decoration

Some model types hand-code the DSL conventions in their API. We should remove these and let the DSL decoration take care of this, to simplify these
types and to offer a more consistent DSL.

* Remove all methods that accept a `Closure` when an `Action` overload is available. Add missing overloads where appropriate.
* Remove all methods that accept a `String` or `Object` when a enum overload is available. Add missing overloads where appropriate.
* Remove CharSequence -> Enum conversion code in `DefaultTaskLogging`.
* Remove all set methods that contain no custom logic.
* Formally document the Closure â†’ Action coercion mechanism
    - Needs to be prominent enough that casual DSL ref readers understand this (perhaps such Action args are annotated in DSL ref)

## Tooling API clean ups

* Move `UnsupportedBuildArgumentException` and `UnsupportedOperationConfigurationException` up to `org.gradle.tooling`, to remove
  package cycle from the API.

## Clean up `Task` DSL and hierarchy

* Remove the `<<` operator.
* Inline `ConventionTask` and `AbstractTask` into `DefaultTask`.
* Remove `Task.dependsOnTaskDidWork()`.
* Mix `TaskInternal` in during decoration and remove references to internal types.

## Remove references to internal classes from API

* Remove `Configurable` from public API types.
* Remove `PomFilterContainer.getActivePomFilters()`.
* Change `StartParameter` so that it no longer extends `LoggingConfiguration`.
* Move `ConflictResolution` from public API (it's only used internally).
* Move `Module` from public API (it's only used internally).
* Move `Logging.ANT_IVY_2_SLF4J_LEVEL_MAPPER` from public API.
* Move `AntGroovydoc` and `AntScalaDoc` from public API.
* Move `BuildExceptionReporter`, `BuildResultLogger`, `TaskExecutionLogger` and `BuildLogger` out of the public API.

## Remove support for convention objects

Extension objects have been available for over 2 years and are now an established pattern.

* Migrate core plugins to use extensions.
* Remove `Convention` type.

## Project no longer inherits from its parent project

* Project should not delegate to its build script for missing properties or methods.
* Project should not delegate to its parent for missing properties or methods.
* Project build script classpath should not inherit anything from parent project.

## Container API tidy-ups

* Remove the specialised subclasses of `UnknownDomainObjectException` and the overridden methods that exist simply to declare this from `PluginContainer`, `ArtifactRepositoryContainer`,
  `ConfigurationContainer`, `TaskCollection`.
* Remove the specialised methods such as `whenTaskAdded()` from `PluginCollection`, `TaskCollection`
* Remove the `extends T` upper bound on the type variable of `DomainObjectCollection.withType()`.
* Remove the type variable from `ReportContainer`
* Remove unused constants from `ArtifactRepositoryContainer`
* Move `ReportContainer.ImmutableViolationException` to make top level.

## Dependency API tidy-ups

* Remove `equals()` implementations from `Dependency` subclasses.
* Remove `ExternalDependency.force`. Use resolution strategy instead.
* Remove `SelfResolvingDependency.resolve()` methods. These should be internal and invoked only as part of resolution.
* Remove `ClientModule` and replace with consumer-side component meta-data rules.
* Remove `ExternalModuleDependency.changing`. Use component meta-data rules instead.

## Invocation API tidy-ups

* Remove the public `StartParameter` constructor.
* Remove the public `StartParameter` constants, `GRADLE_USER_HOME_PROPERTY_KEY` and `GRADLE_USER_HOME_PROPERTY_KEY`.
* Change `StartParameter` into an interface.

## Misc API tidy-ups

* Replace `TaskDependency.getDependencies(Task)` with `TaskDependency.getDependencies()`.
* Remove constants from `ExcludeRule`.
* Rename `IllegalDependencyNotation` to add `Exception` to the end of its name.
* Remove `ConventionProperty`, replace it with documentation.
* Remove `Settings.startParameter`. Can use `gradle.startParameter` instead.
* Remove `org.gradle.util` from default imports.
* Remove `AbstractOptions`.
* Remove or rename `Logging.ANT_IVY_2_SLF4J_LEVEL_MAPPER`.
* Remove unused `EclipseDomainModel`.
* Replace `ShowStacktrace.INTERNAL_EXCEPTIONS` with `NONE`.

## Remove `sonar` plugin

Promote the `sonar-runner` plugin and remove the `sonar` plugin.

## Signing plugin tidy-ups

- `SignatoryProvider` and sub-types should use container DSL instead of custom DSL.

## Decorate classes at load time instead of subclassing

Decorating classes at load time is generally a more reliable approach and offers a few new interesting use cases we can support. For example, by decorating classes
at load time we can support expressions such as `new MyDslType()`, rather than requiring that Gradle control the instantiation of decorated objects.

Switching to decoration at load time should generally be transparent to most things, except for clients of `ProjectBuilder` that refer to types
which are not loaded by Gradle, such as the classes under test.

## Restructure plugin package hierarchy

## buildNeeded and buildDependents

* Rename buildDependents to buildDownstream
* Rename buildNeeded to buildUpstream
* Add a new task buildStream which is equivalent to buildDownstream buildUpstream

## build.gradle in a multiproject build

* A Gradle best pattern is to name the gradle file to be the same name as the subproject.
* Let's support this out of the box, possibly as a preference to `build.gradle`, and maybe drop support for `build.gradle` in subprojects.
